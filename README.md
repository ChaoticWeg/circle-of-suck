# Circle of Suck

### What is a circle of suck?

I'm not a writer so I can't write a better description of a circle of suck than [this][1] by Ryan Nanni of [Banner Society][2]:

> Any time you can build an ouroboros of football teams beating one another, thatâ€™s a Circle of Suck.

To put it into algorithmic terms (my favorite terms): suppose there exists a directed graph whose vertices are sports teams in a given league, and whose edges are contest results in the direction of the victor. A cycle in this graph is a circle of suck.
